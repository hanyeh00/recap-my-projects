# Community Detection in Networks
Community detection is a fundamental task in network analysis that aims to identify groups of nodes that are more densely connected with each other than with the rest of the network. This has applications in social networks, biology, recommendation systems, and more.

## Overview
Communities are one of the most important aspects of complex networks. 
Communityâ€™s structure refers to the nodes in the same community that have dense connections.
There are lots of methods that exist to find communities, most of the existing methods attend to find non-overlapping
community detections, whereas some of them focus on addressing the task of overlapping community detections. 
In this paper we have proposed an approach is based on optimization. At first, all potential overlapping nodes have been found. 
Then the problem of community detection is formulated as an optimization problem,
Galaxy-based Search Algorithm uses local search (modified Hill-Climbing) and chaotic move to find better solution, 
in this essay the algorithm optimizes  normalized mutual information(NMI). 
Finally, we compare this method with existing methods,
we have used GN networks and real-world networks to evaluate our approach,
this experiment is a significant improvement on the problem of community detection.

## Usage
### Example: Detecting communities in a graph
```python
import networkx as nx
from community import community_louvain
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a graph
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Compute the best partition
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Visualize the result
nx.draw(G, node_color=list(partition.values()), with_labels=True, cmap=plt.cm.jet)
plt.show()
```
